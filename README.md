# Background
In the IBM Watson Studio, there is a large collaborative community ecosystem of articles, datasets, notebooks, and other A.I. and ML. assets, which users of the system can interact with. This project is created to explore the recommendation system to enhance the user experience connecting with assets. 

# Motivation
In this project, I will analyze the interactions the users have with the articles on the IBM Watson Studio platform, and make recommendations to them about new articles they would like.

# File Description 
The file in this repository "Recommendations_with_IBM_Chen.ipynb" has all the project details including the python codes. 

# Table of Cotents
